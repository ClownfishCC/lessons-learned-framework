The scenario that was used concerned a severe coastal flooding in large parts of The Hague damaging infrastructure and threatening a large portion of the city's inhabitants. This tabletop trial lasted two days: day 1 - threat of a flooding / day 2 - situation right after the flooding. There were around 110 participants from all over Europe, including practitioners from civil protection and crisis management sectors, solution providers, experts and observers. In this trial the following innovative tools have been tested: 3Di (Nelen en Schuurmans) to simulate flood dynamics, ZKI (DLR and Keep Operational)  to support situational awareness by real-time aerial imaging and analysis, CrisisSuite (Merlin Software) to exchange crisis-related information, HumLogSim (University of Munster) to support planning of resources in  support of evacuation planning, and SIM SAFE (SIM-CI) to assess and visualise the impact of disruptive events and cascading effects.","eventType":"test","eventPhase":"response","location":{"type":"FeatureCollection","features":[{"type":"Feature","properties":{},"geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[4.296065,52.149215],[4.260394,52.122587],[4.222607,52.099234],[4.19663,52.075083],[4.225113,52.050531],[4.367729,52.023667],[4.43758,52.04945],[4.421285,52.103806],[4.363057,52.153816],[4.296065,52.149215]]]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[4.310132,52.082232]}}]},"areaType":"mixed","incidentCategory":"natural","incidentTypes":"cyber_attack","meta":{"revision":70,"created":1564147372193,"version":0,"updated":1579627241067},"$loki":2,"editors":[{"lastEdit":1577746800000,"name":"Dirk Stolk","organisation":"TNO","country":"netherlands","info":"Description and initial overview of analysis results.

The scenario was located in an artificial area. There was a chemical spill in Landpol which is located not far from the border to a neighbouring country. In the flooded buildings there were still people who needed elementary assistance.\nScenario in detail: A maintenance error causes a massive release of a chemical agent. A turncock failure results in the pump, disposing chemical waste into the reservoir, cannot be switched off. Consequently, there is a rapid inflow of a significant amount of a liquid, mud-like, toxic chemical into the retention reservoir. The reservoir’s dikes are weakened after prolonged rainfall and, under great pressure, they break. This releases approximately 2.500.000 cubic metres of toxic fluid as a massive wave that floods the surrounding area in a matter of minutes.","challengesInfo":"The purpose of the trial was to investigate how to adequately support cross-border communication, coordination, and resource management by using socio-technical solutions.

Inhabitants have left their houses being afraid of aftershocks and collapsing of buildings. They have to spend the next days outdoors due to the lack of temporary shelter and blocked roads.\nAll local and national emergency response organizations have been deployed on site (Austrian Red Cross, fire brigades, police and the army); however, due to the extension of the affected area and overwhelmed national response capacities, the union civil protection mechanism was activated. A request of international assistance was activated with regards to medical treatment, water purification as well as search and rescue. Due to the difficulty to access the affected area and considering the impact of the disaster, there is an urgent need for humanitarian assistance and assessment. A large amount of volunteers and rescue equipment is needed to deal with the increasing number of affected people i.e. search and rescue, shelter, medical care, water, food and transportation.

It also provided an opportunity to showcase the main outcomes of this project. The event had been tailored to the needs of the main end-user of this trial – the Emergency Response Coordination Centre (ERCC) – and was conducted in accordance with the project’s methodology. The Final Demo’s overall goal was to show if, and how, the innovative DRIVER+ solutions can minimise a specific set of identified gaps in crisis management.\nNote: The ERCC monitors the situation from Brussels and has an expert support group deployed on the ground called the European Union Civil Protection Coordination Team (EUCPT). The main role of the EUCPT is to coordinate activities in the field by liaising between the UCPM Modules and the Local Emergency Management Authority (of the country stricken by a disaster), in order to provide a common understanding of the needs and to ensure a relevant and timely response. The Final Demo addressed the communication aspects between the UCPM components, mainly the ERCC, the EUCPT and the Modules, which are sent to the country in crisis by states affiliated within the scope of the UCPM.\nThe following innovative solutions have been assessed: CrisisSuite (Merlin Software) to support C3 decision making and information management, SOCRATES OC (GMV) to display a Common Operational Picture by integrating data from other sources, Drone Rapid Mapping (Creotech Instruments) to create othophoto maps of the incident area, vieWTerra (VWORLD) to support the COP with available geographic data, and FRT (EC-JRC) to provide first responders in the field with georeferenced information. \nThe Final Demo took place at the following locations: The Emergency Response Coordination Centre (ERCC) situated in the Space Research Centre of Polish Academy of Sciences (Warsaw, Poland); The European Union Civil Protection Team (EUCPT) located at the Main School of Fire Service (Warsaw, Poland); 4 Ground Forest Fire Fighting using Vehicles (GFFFV) Modules command posts placed in the Main School of Fire Service as well, and 1 AirMedEvac Module command post in the Safety Region Haaglanden (The Hague, The Netherlands).","date":1574722800000,"incidentInfo":"The fictional country Driverstan, situated outside the European Union but relatively close, is a democratic republic, however, is not yet as fully developed as the EU countries – it is lacking solid Crisis Management structures, a stable economy and a strong civil society. The scenario of the Final Demo focused on largescale forest fires in a rural area with potential developments, causing a complex humanitarian crisis.\nDue to high temperatures and lack of rainfall during recent weeks, the number of forest fires is multiplying in the country. Domestic response capabilities are not sufficient to cope with the fires alone. Driverstan creates a Request for Assistance (RfA) that is shared with the ERCC, EU Member States and affiliated countries. The Union Civil Protection Mechanism was activated and offer of support from different countries was gathered.\nThe scenario expected to trigger an exchange of information between the ERCC, EUCPT and the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA). The use of the DRIVER+ selected innovative solutions, tested alongside the standard operational procedures of the ERCC, EUPCT and Modules, demonstrated the potential added value of the solutions in such a Crisis Management situation.","organisations":[{"info":"Main organisator of the Final Demo.","name":"Space Research Centre","type":"research_organisation","country":"poland"},{"info":"To organise the Final Demo, SRC was supported by the DRIVER+ consortium, including: The Main School of Fire Service, the Joint Research Centre, Thales Communication & Security SAS, XVR Simulation BV, Frequentis AG and the Safety Region Haaglanden in The Hague.","name":"Various organisations"},{"info":"Playing the roles of practitioners in this trial by using innovative and/or legacy systems.
