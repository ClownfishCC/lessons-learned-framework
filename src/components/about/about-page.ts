The Lessons Learned Library was developed by Dirk Stolk and Erik Vullings from [TNO](https://wwww.tno.nl) in 2019 as part of the DRIVER+ project. It is a practical implementation of the Lessons Learned Framework (LLF) that was developed in 2017, and includes improvements based on experiences with the LLF demonstrator tool.

This project has received funding from the European Union's 7th Framework Programme for Research, Technological Development and Demonstration under Grant Agreement (GA) NÂ°#607798.`;
